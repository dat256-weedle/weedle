## Debugging

To run the debugger for the app follow these instructions

```terminal
$ yarn start
```

To install react-native with yarn run

```
$ yarn global add expo-cli
```

If tslint is not working with Visual Studio Code a good bet is that tslint has a global yarn install which makes it fail silently.

```terminal
$ yarn global remove tslint
```
