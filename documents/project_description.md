# Project description

## Background
Today there are several parking companies who owns parking spots in a variety of locations. These parking companies use different
apps in order for customers to pay for the parking spots, which means that the drivers can either use lots of different
apps or drive a little further when they park in order to find a parking spot that matches their specific app.

## Idea
We provide an app that connects all the different parking apps so that the user can have the convenience of only using a single app instead
of several (who all fill the same purpose).

## Sustainability
The users don't have to drive a longer distance in order to find a parking spot that matches their specific parking app.

## Mobility
The users will have an easier time to park as more parking spots are available for them, which makes it easier to move around as they want.
