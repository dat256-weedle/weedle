**B:** We need to fully understand the tooling behind the project and the ideas and possible obstacles we should encounter.

## What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s use of Scrum?

**A:** This week there has been very little scrum besides the reflections and the meetings we have had to confirm that the project is moving along.

**B:** Obviously the project should incorporate scrum much more in said process to make sure we have a sane working process.

## What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries?

**A:** This week my contribution has primarily been helping and planning the new project, help decide which tools should be used and helped some individuals of the team understand some of said tools.
