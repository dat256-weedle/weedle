# Week 5 individual reflection by Adam

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

**A:** Same as last week, still very unsure what is the sane way to implement the api fetching.

**B:** I would like to understand the limits, dos and don'ts with said API.

**A->B:** Experiment with said API.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

**A:** Our junior programmers are coming along nicely and contributing to the project, but I feel more confidence can't hurt.

**B:** Make sure they feel comfortable to take decisiions on their own, they mostly seem correct anyway.

**A->B:** Try to encourage everyone it is okay to make mistakes and they should be more self sustaining.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

**A:** Reflections, retrospective, daily scrum, estimations, userstory generation and value to the product owner.

**B:** I still need to more time efficient and try to minimize bickering.

**A->B:** Focus on what is relevant to the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

**A:** Refactor, research and restructuring.

**B:** I want to contribute more code next sprint.

**A->B:** Make it clear I am ready for a bigger workload.

**Enligt diskussion med Håkan, bestämdes det att fortsätta med reflektionerna efter omtentavecka och påskledighet.**
