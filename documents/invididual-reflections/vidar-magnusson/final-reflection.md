# Final individual reflection by Vidar Magnusson

A small side-note about this reflection, **B** will, for all questions, describe what I would want to do for the next project I'm going to do with the scrum methodology.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
**A:** Throughout the course I've learned many different things, firstly the language we used was somewhat new to me. In the project we used Typescript/React-Native where React-Native is relatively similar to React which I have used before. The way in which we used the languages (for mobile development) was, however, completely new to me and is something that I've been wanting to learn for some time now.

Secondly, developing in a javascript based language in a more "serious" context was also new to me. When I've worked in javascript/React previously it has always been for smaller projects where tests, continuous integration and such have been missing. As it turns out, testing javascript in a meaningful matter is often really hard due to it mostly being UI testing. A part from data-handling functions our tests have mostly been focused on checking that the components are actually working at all (and therefor not many use-case based tests). 

Third, SCRUM, of which I had some experience of from a previous course where we learned of user stories, epics, tasks and the importance of trying to make these vertical rather than horisontal. That project, however, was much more focused on code quality and the implementation of the project, rather than the workflow and methodology that this course has focused on. This is also something that I feel that I have learned much about by not only the lectures but mostly by just working throughout the project and running into problems ourselves. An example of this was for our early sprints where we thought we had a pretty good task breakdown but we then ran into the problem of different people having interpreted a user story in two different ways. After this we really started to thoroughly going through our user stories and making sure that ever task was crystal clear to everyone and described all parts of the user story in full. 

Lastly as a sort of continuation of SCRUM I feel that I (and the rest of the group) really have improved the way our planning sessions go. From them taking several hours to only taking one to two hours. This was done mostly by splitting our planning sessions into two time-boxed clearly defined types, backlog refinement and sprint planning and was something that we learned after reading the course litterature.

**B:** For the next project I mainly want to focus on two things, having the same time-boxed backlog refinement/sprint planning sessions as we had at the end of this course as I feel that it really helped streamlining our meetings whilst also helped us get better results from them. The other thing is to have the same level of task breakdown that we had in our second last sprint (the quality went down somewhat in the last sprint due to us almost "spamming" bug-fix user stories in a short amount of time) from the start of the project as I feel that it really helped me (and I believe everyone else as well) to be on the same page of what should be done with each user story and also helped with collaborative user stories.   

**A->B:** Before the next project of this type I probably want to re-read the sprint planning chapter in the course litterature of this course as I really felt it contains many useful tips and most notably great examples.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
**A:** In the beginning of the course the knowledge level of the language etc that we decided to use was extremely varied, some people being very experienced with them, me and some others being somewhat familiar and having some experience with it and lastly some that had no experience with them what so ever. In the beginning we decided to tackle this by having some collective "lectures" and learning sessions as well as doing a lot of pair programming with one more experienced person and one less experienced person. Whilst the amount of "features" delievered by people still does vary from (partly from these starting-knowledge differences) I am truly impressed of how much everyone has contributed and done their best to deliver the product that we wanted and feel that everyone has done everything that could be asked from them considering the circusomtances. 

**B:** For the next project if there should exist similar differences I feel that the way we tried to solve this worked out quite well pereferably (if possible) even better.

**A->B:** In the next project maybe spend even more time as a group and sharing with eachother, even if everyone on different things, sitting together makes it very easy to help eachother out with problems that arises. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
**A:** I have participated (and been active) in almost every group meeting (except for one or two "group programming" sessions) where we have done all of our planning / reflection work (a part from the individual reflections). I have answered our "daily-scrum bot" each day (we had a bot on slack posting the three daily-scrum questions each work-day throughout the course). I have worked with with the tasks/user stories that have been assigned to me and demonstrated the results to the groups' Product Owner. 

**B:** For the next project I want to bring my experiences from this course where needed to help streamline the workprocess to create a product. I don't want to bring the idea of a chat based daily-scrum as I really don't think it gave much value to the group. We tried to change it up a bit a couple of times but it didn't help. In this project we haven't really had the ability to meet up every morning so that's really the limiting factor in this regard. 

**A->B:** Probably same as the first question, re-reading parts of the course litterature but also probably recommending that we do not do daily-scrum in a chat.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
**A:** The last time I checked gitinspector I had more than 20-25% of the lines and whilst this doesn't necessarily reflect the amount of value provided to the product I feel that in this case they match up relatively well, I've spent the amount of time that the course and the group has expected of me (20 hours a week on average) and feel that I can be proud of my part in our final product. Me having some previous knowledge of the language and in general have quite a bit of experience with programming and software development but also thinking it is really fun, having helped me to reach this goal. 

**B:** In the next project I want to keep doing my best and giving my all to develop a great product, mostly because programming is also a hobby of mine and I think it's fun to develop software of different kinds.

**A->B:** I feel that I already am where I want to be when it comes to help teams I'm deliver what we want to deliver.
