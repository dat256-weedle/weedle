# Final individual reflection by Vidar Magnusson

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
**A:** Throughout the course I've learned many different things, firstly the language we used was somewhat new to me. In the project we used Typescript/React-Native where React-Native is relatively similar to React which I have used before. The way in which we used the languages (for mobile development) was, however, completely new to me and is something that I've been wanting to learn for some time now.
