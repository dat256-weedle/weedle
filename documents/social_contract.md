# Social contract - Group Weedle

## Level of ambition

The group aims for a grade of 5.
Goal with the project: create the best possible work-process for using SCRUM to create a product.

## Being on time

The members of the group will show up to meetings in time, with a 5-minute flex timer. It is disrespectful towards to the group to not follow this. If a member of the group is unable to arrive on time they will immediately inform the group of this.

## Communication

The communication in the group is done through Slack and through the meetings of the group.

## Deadlines

All turn-ins (Group and individual) is turned in on Thursdays. The SCRUM master will make sure that the members have turned in their parts.

## Workload

We respect that the group members should only work 20 hours per week, and we won't
force people to work on weekends to get done with an unfinished user story. All course
activities counts, including meetings, lectures and lecture feedback.

## Group structure

The group has a SCRUM master / group leader and a secretary.
**The SCRUM master**: Makes sure that there is an agenda before each meeting and keeps track of the meetings order of business. Also makes sure that the individual assignments are turned in on time.
**Secretary**: Writes a protocol for each meeting and makes sure this exists on GitHub after the meeting.

## Meeting times

The group has meetings on Mondays 13:00-15:00 and Thursdays 10:00-12:00.

## Meeting protocol

The protocol is written directly in GitHub by the secretary.

## Decision-making

At least 5 members of the group need to be present in order to make a group decision, and there need to be a majority in order for the decision to pass. Should the vote result in a draw then no decision is made and the decision will be taken at later date.

## Personal- and group-conflicts

If a personal conflict arises it should be resolved by the involved parties if possible. If the conflict is a problem for the group it will be resolved with the group where at least 5 people participate, including the involved persons.

## Daily Scrum

Each day (from course-week 3) a daily SCRUMB meeting will be held over Slack. Each morning (on work-days) before 10:00 each member of the group will write a message containing the following:

- What you have done since yesterday.
- Problems you might need help with.
- What you're going to do today.

## Coding Conventions

- All code and comments will be written in English.
- Git commit messages should be short, concise and sufficiently describe what has changed.
- All PR:s should be reviewed by at least 2 other members of the group.
- No force pushes to master / develop should be made.
- The person who created a pull request is also the person that merges it.
- TODO:s are not allowed.

## Frameworks

User stories: GitHub
Language: JavaScript
Language library: React Native

## Roles

The group decided to make **Pontus Lindblom** the SCRUM master and **Oscar Ã–stberg** the secretary.

## How the social contract is changed

The person who bring up a change to the social contract is responsible to implement it into the contract, as long as the group agree.
