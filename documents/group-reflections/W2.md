# Group reflection for group Weedle (Week 2)

## Customer value and Scope

### The chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value

The development of the project has not yet begun and therefor this question is not yet relevant.

### The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project (this can include the application, but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or your effort)

- The success criteria for the application is to have a close to functioning product (possible with some mockup features). 

- The learning outcomes for the week is to improve our knowledge of scrum. 

- Teamwork: Learn how to collaborate in a group with different competences.

- The success criteria for this week in terms of our effort is to complete the tasks that are deadlined this week as well preparing for project development start.

### Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and how this influenced the way you worked and created value

- We've decided to draft our initial user stories on monday and therefor this question is not yet relevant.

### Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed, with whom, and which value they provided for you and the other stakeholders

- We've tested and voted upon our mockup and buisness model canvas which provides value to us a group in that it gives a common goal. They could also provide value for our product owner so that they can give their initial input on what we're going to produce.  

### The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your process

Our kpis may not be finished yet but as of now we see these as potentially good KPIs:

**Kpis:**

## Social Contract and Effort

### Your social contract i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project (this means, of course, you should create one in the first week and continuously update it when the need arrives)

The social contract was drafted durign week one and this far we've only followed it without any changes/additions.

### The time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)

A part from lectures, the members of the group have spent an average of 7-8 hours this week during group meetings as well as the work on the buisness model canvas and mockup. 

## Design decisions and product structure

### How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value
We have decided upon some of the tools/frameworks that are going to be used in the course, however nothing has yet been implemented and therefor no value has yet been provided for the customer. 

### Which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)
We don't have any techincal documents yet. 

### How you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints
We don't have any code document yet.

### How you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards
We've decided to enforce code review on anything that is going to be merged with the master branches and that we're going to use continous integration.

## Application of Scrum

### The roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work
Currently we have assigned a secretary and a scrum master. 

### The agile practices you have used and their impact on your work
We have reflected and had retrospectives on the two weeks of work we've currently done in the course. We've also assigned a scrum master as well as decided upon a scrum board to use. 

### The sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (in the first weeks in terms of the outcome of the current week's exercise; in later weeks in terms of your meetings with the product owner)

### Best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.; do not only describe which tools you used but focus on how you developed the expertise to use them)

### Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)
